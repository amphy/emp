# EMP 03-12-20 Notes/Worksheet

Hi! Since we will not be able to meet in person this week, I've put together a notes/worksheet that you can work through on your own to get some of the material we would have reviewed during the EMP session. This will be very similar to our regular notes, but with some of the verbal questions added as questions to think about in each section. Please leave feedback on the forum for things you want to see or improvements because I'm not sure how long we will have to be in an online format for.
