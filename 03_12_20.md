# EMP 03-12-20 Notes/Worksheet

Hi! Since we will not be able to meet in person this week, I've put together a notes/worksheet that you can work through on your own to get some of the material we would have reviewed during the EMP session. This will be very similar to our regular notes, but with some of the verbal questions added as questions to think about in each section. Please leave feedback on the forum for things you want to see or improvements because I'm not sure how long we will have to be in an online format for.

## Polymorphism and References (review)

#### What is the  **root** object?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	<p>

**Object**
</p></details>

#### What **three methods** do all Java objects inherit from the root object?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	<p>

		
`String toString()`, `boolean equals(Object other)`, and `int hashCode()`
</p></details>

We have talked for the previous two weeks about how to override methods. If I wanted to override the `toString()` method in a class called `Pet`, how would I do that?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>

```java
public class Pet {
    @Override // Do we need this tag to override?
    public String toString() {
		return "This is a pet"; // can return anything that is a STRING here
	}
}
```
</details>

We've also talked about hierarchy with Java objects. We know when `Dog extends Pet` that `Dog` is the child class and `Pet` is the parent class. When we create a `Dog` object and call the method `speak()` on this object, where do we start to look for or resolve this method?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**The `Dog` Class**
</details>

#### If the method is not there, where do we go next to look for this method?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**The parent class/the next ancestor**

In our example, we would check the `Pet` class next since it is the parent of `Dog`.
</details>


#### How long do we continue this search for?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**Until the name is found or the search fails**

When does the search fail? It fails when we reach the *root* and haven't found what we are looking for.
</details>

Two weeks ago, we talked about **subtype polymorphism**. Let's pretend we have the following code:

```java
public class Pet {
	public void speak() {
		System.out.println("I am a pet");
	}
}

public class Dog extends Pet {
	public void speak() {
		woof();
	}

	public void woof() {
		System.out.println("Woof");
	}
}

```

#### In Java, *every* object can be referred to as at least 2 types. For example, a `Pet` can also be referred to as ________.

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**an `Object`**
</details>

#### What are the possible other types for an object of type `Dog`?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**an `Object` or a `Pet`**
</details>

In Java, we upcast automatically. However, instances still **return their types**. What does this mean? Let's take the following example that builds off the `Pet` and `Dog` classes we made earlier.

```java
Dog d = new Dog();
Pet p = (Pet) d; // is it necessary to cast here?
p.speak();
```

#### In the above example, what does the last line print?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**Woof**

Why is this the case? `p` is referencing a `Dog` object even though the reference type is a `Pet`. Since our object is type `Dog`, where do we start looking for the `speak()` method?
</details>

#### Unlike upcasting, downcasting is not automatic. When can we downcast a reference?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**When the instance is actually the appropriate subtype**

What does this mean? If we have the following:
```java
Dog d = new Dog();
Pet p = (Pet) d;
Dog d2 = (Dog) p;
```
It only works when `p` has an object type of `Dog`, or something that could be a `Dog` (like a child of `Dog`).
</details>

Since we need to check if an instance is an appropriate subtype to downcast, we can use the `instanceof` operator to check before downcasting.

Example:
```java
System.out.println(p instanceof Dog) // returns true
```

We've mentioned **reference** type and **object** or instance type. Keep in mind that **references are not objects**. They are references because they refer to an object. When I do the following, I am copying the reference to the object, not copying the object itself. (For a good visualization, check out the [Object References](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/learn/2020_03_04_object_references) slides).

```java
Dog d = new Dog();
Dog d2 = d;
```


Copying just the reference is also known as creating a **shallow copy**. What we want to create (creating an actual copy of the object) is called a **deep copy**.

#### In the above example, how many **references** are there?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**2**
</details>

#### How many objects or instances are there?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**1**

Why? When do we actually create an object? (think of the keyword that we use)
</details>

#### If I wrote `d == d2`, what would be the value of this equality?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**true**

Why? In this case, the two references are equal because they refer to the **same object**. We only have 1 object in this example. Because `==` returns true, using `.equals()` should almost always return true as well.

If the two references weren't equal, we might still want `.equals()` to return true if the objects have the same attributes.
</details>


Since the above code copies the reference, not the object, how can I copy the actual object? It's important here to think about what it means to actually copy an object. Say I had the following class and made an instance of this class:

```java
public class Dice {
	private int numSides;
	private String color;
	public Dice(int n, String c) {
		numSides = n;
		this.color = c; // do we have to use this.color?
	}
}

Dice myDice = new Dice(6, "red");
```

#### If I wanted to copy the object referenced in `myDice`, what needs to be true about my copied object?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**It should have the same numSides and color as `myDice`**
</details>

#### From the slides, Geoff mentions two possible ways for us to copy an object. What are they?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**use a `clone` method or implement a copy constructor**

A **copy constructor** for our Dice class would look like the following:
```java
public Dice(Dice other) {
	// other is the Dice to copy
	numSides = other.numSides;
	color = other.color; // color and numSides are private, so why can we still use other.color and other.numSides?
}

```
Remember this would be like just another constructor in our Dice class. How does this constructor differ from constructors we have written before? (Hint: look at the parameters we use)
</details>

I've been using object and reference type, but keep in mind that an object is an instance, so we can also use **instance type**. This is probably what you'll see in quizzes, etc.

#### To connect this, we said in subtype polymorphism that any object can be **referred to** as at least 2 types. If we use our `Pet` and `Dog` example from before, what are the possible **reference types** for a `Dog` instance?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**We could use `Dog`, `Pet`, or `Object`.**
</details>

So if instance type seems so important, why do we care about the reference type? The reason is that the reference type controls **what methods and variables we can access**. What does this mean?

Let's take an example we wrote earlier.

```java
Dog d = new Dog();
Pet p = (Pet) d; // is it necessary to cast here?
p.speak();
```

In this example, we said the instance type determined where we started looking for the `speak()` method which in turn determined what implementation we actually ran (printing "Woof" instead of "I am a Pet"). However, what if we tried to do the following: 

```java
p.woof();
```

#### The instance type of `p` is `Dog`. What would we print in this case?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**We wouldn't print anything because this line would cause an error.**

Why? While the instance type of `p` is `Dog`, the **reference** type of `p` is `Pet`. This means we can only access methods that are defined in `Pet` even though we can use the `Dog` implementation of them. That's why `p.speak()` will work while `p.woof()` does not (`speak()` is defined in the `Pet` class).
</details>

Additionally, when Java tries to match method signatures (find the correct method to use), it uses the **reference type** which motivates one of our reasons for polymorphism below. Java can automatically upcast until it finds a matching method signature or the call fails.

Having to remember all of this seems like a lot of work. Why have polymorphism at all? This was a question that was asked last week when we went over polymorphism. As Geoff mentions in the slides, polymorphism helps us create descendant classes that can implement or override ancestor behavior while keeping wanted properties of our ancestors.

**Example:** Having a `Dog` class that extends `Pet` lets us keep parts of `Pet` that we want (think back to previous homework where we had a `Pet` class that had a `name` attribute) while also letting us override things that should be unique to Dogs (Dogs should "Woof" when they speak). *We have to repeat less code this way.*

Additionally, we can take advantage of the fact that one object can have multiple reference types. We can write methods that work for any descendant class of a type or, as another example from last EMP, we could even create data structures that can store multiple object types with the same reference type. 

Assume we have a parent class called `Student` and two child classes `Undergraduate` and `Graduate`. Say we want to store a roster of students for this class. If we have a class that both undergraduates and graduate students can take, one way you could solve this would be to create a graduate student list and an undergraduate student list. However, this means you would always need to check for the type and you would need to manage two lists. Using polymorphism, we could solve this a different way:

```java
Student[] roster = new Student[30]; // assume we know how many students there are
roster[0] = new Undergraduate();
roster[1] = new Graduate();
// we could do this until we fill all 30 slots
```

This allows us to keep objects of different types (`Undergraduate` and `Graduate`) in one array instead of two. Then later when we want to print out the students, we can just loop through the `Student` array versus two different arrays.

#### If things are higher on the object hierarchy, what is true about them?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>

**They are more general, but can use fewer capabilities.**

What about things lower on the object hierarchy?
</details>

Recall that we learned the `final` keyword for creating constants. We can also use `final` with classes to prevent a class from being extended.

```java
public final class Book {
	// ...code for class would go here
}
```


## Class Design: Abstract, Inner Classes, Interface

In this next section, we will review a few different types of classes you might encounter (besides the normal classes we have been writing).

### Abstract Classes

In the last section, we talked about `final` being used to prevent a class from being extended. We have another class keyword `abstract` that means a class can **only** be extended and **cannot be instantiated**. This part is particularly important. If we have the following code:

```java
public abstract class Pet {
	private String name;

	public abstract void speak();
	public abstract int getNumLegs();
	public abstract void giveTreat(int numTreats);

	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}

	public void setName(String s) {
		name = s;
	}
}
```

we cannot just create an instance of `Pet` like `Pet p = new Pet()`. From the above code, we notice a few things about abstract classes:

- First, they use the **abstract** keyword when defining the class
- An abstract class can have abstract methods (which also use the abstract keyword), but it does not have to
- We can have regular methods with implementations like we do in regular Parent classes
- We can define instance variables within abstract classes 

Since we can't create an instance of `Pet`, what can we do to use this class? We can **extend** it.

```java
public class Dog extends Pet {
	public Dog(String s) {
		setName(s);
	}

	public void speak() {
		System.out.println("Woof");
	}
	public int getNumLegs() {
		return 4;
	}
	public void giveTreat(int numTreats) {
		System.out.println("You gave " + numTreats + " treats!");
	}
}
```

Since `Dog` extends `Pet`, it has to implement **all abstract methods**. This is because these methods have no implementations, so `Dog` must provide one. Otherwise, when someone calls this method, Java doesn't know what to actually do. Notice once we implement these abstract methods, we do not use the abstract keyword with them (in the child).

Additionally, since `Dog` extends `Pet` it inherits the `name` variable and `getName()` and `setName(String s)` methods. We do not have to declare these in `Dog` since it should automatically have these. When we make the `Dog` constructor, we use `setName` because `Dog` has no access to the private variable `name` in `Pet`. However, we can use `super()` here if we define a constructor in `Pet`. Even though `Pet` cannot be instantiated, we can still create a constructor in the `Pet` class.

### Inner Classes

When we write classes, we normally use

```java
public class ClassName {
	// .. class stuff
}
```

We can't have **private** classes because we wouldn't be able to use them. However, we can do something similar to a private class by creating a **inner class**.

```java
public class Dog {
	class DogFood {
		public String toString() {
			return "kibble";
		}
	}
	private DogFood myFood;
	Dog() {
		myFood = new DogFood();
	}
}
```

Similar to how a child will inherit methods and variables of its parent, a child will also inherit inner classes.


### Interfaces

Our focus is on interfaces in Java. If you don't remember what an interface is, I would recommend checking out the examples in the slides. There are some good examples and alternative definitions that might be useful for understanding. Programmatically though, we can think of interfaces as very similar to something we've seen before: **abstract classes**.

**An important note before we start: Every Java object has an interface**. The interface is the set of methods it provides. You could think of this as something like "The `Pet` class has only one method called `speak()`". Because interfaces allow us to separate the functionality from the implementation, it requires us to communicate between *users* of an interface and the *providers* of an interface. The *users* implement the functions defined in an interface while the *providers* define what functions an interface should have.

Since interfaces are similar (but not the same!) to abstract classes, the syntax seems like it should be similar. To **declare** an interface, we can do the following:

```java

```
