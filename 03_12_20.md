# EMP 03-12-20 Notes/Worksheet

Hi! Since we will not be able to meet in person this week, I've put together a notes/worksheet that you can work through on your own to get some of the material we would have reviewed during the EMP session. This will be very similar to our regular notes, but with some of the verbal questions added as questions to think about in each section. Please leave feedback on the forum for things you want to see or improvements because I'm not sure how long we will have to be in an online format for.

## Polymorphism and References

#### What is the  **root** object?

**Object**

#### What **three methods** do all Java objects inherit from the root object?

<details>
	<summary>Answer:</summary>
	<p>
		
`String toString()`, `boolean equals(Object other)`, and `int hashCode()`
</p></details>

We have talked for the previous two weeks about how to override methods. If I wanted to override the `toString()` method in a class called `Pet`, how would I do that?

        <p>

```java
public class Pet {
    @Override // Do we need this tag to override?
	public String toString() {
	    return "This is a pet"; // can return anything that is a STRING here
	}
}
```
</p></details>
